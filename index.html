                There's no denying that the film photography 
                has made an unmistakable comeback. 
                The way a film camera captures moments 
                is unlike any DSLR camera- the grain and 
                grittiness of the photo create a series 
                of imperfect, perfect pictures. As social media 
                continues to paint images of perfect photos 
                of people with perfect lives, families, and careers, 
                film photos challenge this preconceived notion 
                and add unique contrast.
